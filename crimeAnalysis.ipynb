        "<p><b>Crime analysis is the systematic study of identifying and analyzing the patterns in terms of crime and disorder. Information on patterns can help law enforcement agencies deploy resources in a more effective manner and assist detectives in their investigations.</b> Crime analysis also plays a vital role in formulating crime prevention strategies. It's only through crime analysis that we can see the bigger picture and crucially an objective picture of what's going on. Besides these, crime analysis also provide the objective information that decision makers can use to determine <b>\"what to do\", \"where to do it\" and \"which resources to allocate to do it.\"</b></p>\n",
        "<p>So, <b>to derive statistics about crime – to estimate its levels and trends,  and inform law enforcement approaches to prevent it</b> – a conceptual framework for defining and thinking about crime is virtually a prerequisite. Developing and maintaining such a framework is no easy task, because the mechanics of crime are ever evolving and shifting. However, we can first analyze the violent crime data and find out the patterns and crimes occuring in the states of a country and then we can deploy strict survilliance systems to guard those cities and lower the crime rates.</p>\n",
        "<p> Here, we will conduct our analysis  to find answer to these research questions.</p>\n",

        "In the timeframe that was covered in the dataset, it is shown through the various graphs that crimes have been in a constant increase between 1975 and the 90s. Around maybe 25-30 years ago, the number of reported crimes have decreased significantly, often showing a stark contrast between the numbers reported at the peak and a few years later. This phenomenon is generalized to the entire country and is called the \"Great Crime Decline\". \n",
        "\n",
        "Many theorize on the causes behind these drops in number of crimes. Some theories say that maybe it is because the neighborhoods that were hotspots are being gentrified, which means there is better economic activity in those neighborhoods, which leads to a lesser need or desire for people to commit crimes. It also leads to increased security with maybe more police forces there as a deterrent. Another theory that is out there is that technology is keeping people inside. There is this idea that if people are busy in front of their computers and TVs, they will not be committing crimes. There also are politicians who want to have the merits of this decline, like Bill Clinton after he passed his massive crime bill in which there were things that disproportionately affected people of color and minorities. The truth is that crime experts and researchers do not agree on one single answer, so we do not know what exactly caused that decrease. \n",

        "If we can create a model that can predict the number of violent crimes that can occur in each state, then law enforcement agencies can deploy resources in a more effective manner and assist detectives in their investigations. Considering this situation, we have created a model based on random forest to predict the number of violent crimes in each state in the upcoming year. However, the model we have created is not getting good accuracy.\n",

        "The reason behind this is the lack of sufficient data. Here in this dataset, the crime data is provided in a year basis. We can \n",
        "design our prediction model to give more accurate results if there is an availability of  data of reported crimes\n",
        "each day at different cities. LSTM are often used to do time series analysis but here we have treated this problem as regression\n",

        " So, this report provides moreover an analytical summary of whether the crimes rates are rising or falling in America, which crimes are reported more often and in which states the crimes rates are increasing or declining so that we can get an overall view of what's going on in the country in order to deploy the appropriate resources needed to counter crime, whethe it be by puttin more police officers, by offering better mental health support to communities or by applying what experts and academics will demand."
