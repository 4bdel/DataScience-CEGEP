<h1> Crime Rate data analysis and visualization</h1>
In these projects written as a college student, I was interested in looking at crime rates in the United States. 
<h2>1. State Population Size and Crime Rates</h2>
In a first project, I looked at whether the size of the population in each US state is correlated to the rate of murders. Using Python and libraries like MatplotLib, Pandas and NumPy, I was able to manipulate a dataset with data from the FBI and the US Department of Justice. The dataset is available at the following link: https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/state_crime/. After cleaning the rows and columns of the dataset, I plotted the murder rates against the population for each state, and determined that there does not seem to be a correlation between the two, based solely on the size of each individual state.

<h2>2. Violent Crimes Analysis </h2>
The python notebook is available, the name is Violent-Crimes-Analysis.ipynb, or directly at the following link in Google Colab: <li>https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aAsFtBWzu_MimLrx8Qb4SDzILqakissM?usp=sharing

<p>In the second project, in a team of two we looked deeper and studied crime rates not in states, but in cities. The dataset used is named "report.csv" in this repository. Doing so allowed us to answer the same question as the first project, namely to know whether there is a link between population size and crime rates. We used the Seaborn library which allowed us to plot interactive graphs where lines of data can be isolated, zoomed in and more.</p>

Below is an example of a result we have obtained, concerning rape cases during the period of 1975 to 2015.

The graph presented below shows the total number of crimes during the same period.

From our analyses, we concluded that from 1975 to early 1990s, crimes were on a constant increase, until around 1991 where they started decreasing drastically.
