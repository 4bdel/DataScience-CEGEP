# Crime Rate data analysis and visualization
Crime rates and population python projects
In these projects written as a college student, I was interested in looking at crime rates in the United States. In a first project, I looked at whether the size of the population in each US state is correlated to the rate of murders. Using Python and libraries like MatplotLib, Pandas and NumPy, i was able to manipulate a dataset with data from the FBI and the US Department of Justice. The dataset is available at the following link: https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/state_crime/ , or in this repository under the name report.csv. After cleaning the rows and columns of the dataset, I was graphed the murder rates against the population for each state, and determined that there does not seem to be a correlation between the two, based solely on the size of each individual state.
